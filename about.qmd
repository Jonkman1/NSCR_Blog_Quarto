### What are the NSC-R Workshops?

The **NSC-R Workshops** is a series of weekly one-hour online instructional sessions to support participants in developing their data science skills in R, and to promote open science principles. The NSC-R workshop meetings are organized by a team affliated with the Netherlands Institute for the Study of Crime and Law Enforcement [(NSCR)](https://www.nscr.nl/en/), but they are open to everyone, regardless of affiliation or skill level. All the material of the blog you can find [here](https://github.com/Jonkman1/NSCR_Web)

The NSC-R Workshop Team coordinates the NSC-R Workshops. They discuss potential topics, invite presenters, plan the meetings and send invitations. Currently the team includes Wim Bernasco, Franziska Yasrebi-de Kom, Sam Langton, Asier Moneva and Alex Trinidad.
