It was presented by Thomas de Graaff.\nHere you find the presentation\nTo prepare for the first meeting, Thomas de Graaff suggested you might want to take a look at the following links. This is obviously not mandatory, but the materials may give rise to ideas or questions that you may want to discuss in the workshop meeting:\n\nA very readable post on reproducible workflow in R.\nA nice short blog post about R projects.\nIf you are using R already and in particular if you use tidyverse, a long book-down document about coding style conventions.\nA wonderful but distressing lecture (and long: about 50 minutes) from Richard McElreath about working with software in the social sciences, with a criminology paper example in the end on racial disparity in police use of deadly force.

    "section": "",
    "text": "According to David Buil-Gil, victimization surveys provide key information about crimes known and unknown to the police, and are the main source of data to analyse perceived safety and confidence in policing. These surveys, however, are only designed to allow aggregating responses and producing reliable direct estimates (i.e., weighted means or totals) at very large spatial scales, such as countries or states. Sample sizes are too small to produce direct estimates of adequate precision at the increasingly refined spatial scales of the criminology of place. Model-based small area estimation techniques may be used to improve the reliability of small area estimates produced from victimization surveys. Small area estimation techniques are applied to produce reliable estimates of parameters of interest (and their associated measures of error) for areas for which only small or zero sample sizes are available. This workshop will introduce theory and show a step-by-step exemplar study in R to illustrate the utility of small area estimation for crime and place research. You find materials here. And his presentation here\n\nDavid Buil-Gil is a Lecturer in Quantitative Criminology at the Department of Criminology of the University of Manchester, and a core member of the Manchester Centre for Digital Trust and Society. His research areas cover geographic criminology, small area estimation applications in criminology, measurement error in criminological research, new methods for data collection, and open data."

    "text": "Distill is a package built on and for RMarkdown, the ecosystem of packages for creating computational documents in R.\nThe goal of the distill package is to provide an output format optimized for online scientific and technical communication. The distill-R package provides HTML output formats for R Markdown documents. With the use of distill you can make articles, blogs and websites.\nThe goal of the developers of distill was to create a platform to help scientists harness the benefits of modern HTML-based communication, which digital designers and journalists have been using to create interactive and engaging articles that meet readers where they are: online.\nIn this workshop you are introduced to this package. You learn how to build your own website and blog, how to place it on GitHub and deploy it for free by using Netlify. Harrie Jonkman and the NSC-R team members developed a website for the NSC-R workshops by using distill (you are reading it right now).\n\nMore information\n\nA very accessible description of how to use distill to build websitres is Building a distill website by by Liza Lendway.\nAnother description of how to build websites with distill is Building a blog with distill, targeted.\ndistill was created by people at R Studio. This is RStudio’s official website link on distill\nYou could also check out RStudio’s new developments on distill\n\n\nHarrie Jonkmanis a senior researcher at the Verwey Jonker Institute.

    "text": "Network analysis is a topic of growing interest in criminology and beyond. This workshop gives a short introduction and overview of network analysis in R, beginning with a conceptual discussion of what networks are. In their simplest form, networks are comprised of actors (“nodes”) and relationships between them (“edges”). Network analysis concerns the analytical approach to study these edges between nodes of any kind (e.g., individuals, businesses, experiences, words, or streets). The workshop proceeds with an introduction to network analysis in R, focusing on i) creating and reading network data; ii) describing and visualizing networks; and iii) explaining the formation of networks.\nJoin this workshop meeting on Thursday January 20, 2022 at 13:00 on Zoom by clicking this link\nTo prepare for the workshop, you may want to install a few R packages (just copy and paste these lines into your R Studio Editor and run them):\ninstall.packages(“tidyverse”)\ninstall.packages(“igraph”)\ninstall.packages(“tidygraph”)\ninstall.packages(“ggraph”)\ninstall.packages(“statnet”)\n\nIeke de Vries is an Assistant Professor at the Institute of Criminal Law and Criminology at Leiden University.

    "text": "Discrete choice is choosing a single item or action from a finite set of alternatives. We do it all the time, when we shop for new clothes, select a dish from the menu, choose to commute by bus, train or bike, select a job or an applicant, or when we swipe potential partners on Tinder.\nDiscrete spatial choice is when the alternatives are spatial entities, e.g. when we choose where to buy a house, where to go on holiday, or where to commit a crime. With data on what has been chosen and on what could have been chosen, discrete choice models can help us understand the decision process and predict its outcome: how do features of the alternatives (e.g. monetary cost of profits, distance, comfort, taste, looks) affect which alternative is chosen?\nIn this workshop, Wim Bernasco explained the key elements of discrete choice models, just enough for you to get going and still know what you are doing.

One (crime.csv) contains the number of police recorded residential burglaries, bike thefts and assaults in the Netherlands per month between January 2012 and April 2022. The other (population.csv) contains the number of inhabitants of the Netherlands during the same period, per first day of the month (below, in the Materials section, you can find a link to the R script that creates these files by downloading open data from Statistics Netherlands).\nIn the workshop we will together try to make sense of long-term temporal trends in these crimes, and hopefully also make useful statements about how things changed when the COVID pandemic arrived around February 2020.\nWe would suggest you just spend a single hour on preparation, no matter how far you get. Use any help you can find. Even very experienced R users consult the help files, their colleagues and the internet all the time, and so should you. Make sure you keep your R code in a script that you could share in the workshop, so we can learn from your ideas and creativity, and from your issues and errors.\n\nCreate a new folder on the computer where you run R, and store the two datafiles crime.csv and residents.csv in the folder.\nRead both files from disk and assign each a name. Any name will do, but I suggest “crime” and ” residents”.\nExplore the structure of the files. How many rows (observations), how many columns (variables), what are the variable names? What are their types: Are they integers, characters, dates, factors, …? keys?\nVisualize (plot) the development of the population size of the Netherlands between January 2012 and April 2022, and do the same for the frequencies of residential burglary, bike theft and assault.\nCreate a residential burglary rate by relating number of residential burglaries to the size of the population, and think about how you can adjust for different months having a differentnumbers of days (28-31). To do this, you will need to merge (join) the “crime” dataframe with the “residents” dataframe by year and month.\nVisualize the development of the three crime rates.\nWhat can we say about the development of crime since February 2020, relative to the developments between 2012 and 2020? How can you quantify this with the data at hand?\nDo anything else with the data that you find fun or seems to make sense\n\n\nWim Bernasco is senior researcher at NSCR and professor at the School of Business and Economics at the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam.

You can name it whatever you want, but it is good practice to not include spaces. So, perhaps call it something like “tidytuesday_may2022”.\nOpen up RStudio. In the top left, you will see blue cube icon which when you hover over it will say Create a project. Click on this icon, choose existing directory, Browse, and then find and select the folder you have just created (e.g., tidytuesday_may2022). Once the folder has been selected, click Create Project.\nYou are now working in an R Project, hooray! One major benefit of working within an R Project is that all your working directories will now begin wherever the project is located (i.e., the tidytuesday_may2022 folder). Try this now by running getwd() in the R Console. If you save all your data, scripts and project materials here, or in subfolders, you will find it way easier to manage your work, and your code will look cleaner too, courtesy of the shorter working directories.\nLet’s start by creating some relevant folders in our project folder. You can do this manually, but let’s try it in RStudio. In the R Console, just type and run dir.create(\"scripts\"). This should have created a new folder called scripts in your project folder. You can save all your scripts here. Try it again for our data folder: dir.create(\"data\"). These subfolders should now existing within your project folder.\nFor the workshop, we are going to use some open data on 911 calls in Detroit, United States. I have written a very short script which loads the data automatically. You just need to download this script, save it in the scripts folder, and run it. You can find the script here. Either copy and paste the code into an R script, or right click on Raw (right hand side) and click Save link as…. Remember to save the script in your scripts folder.\nOpen up the script and run it. It should download the data automatically and then end with a brief summary of the data thanks to glimpse().\nTry to figure out the following. No pressure – you can ask us about anything queries or problems you have during the workshop!\n\n\nWhat variable names are in the data?\nHow many 911 calls for service (i.e., rows) do we have?\nWhat is the average response time (totalresponsetime) for calls?\nWhat is the most common call type? The call type is defined by the calldescription variable.\nHow many calls were in-progress shots fired (‘SHOTS FIRED IP’)?\nHow does average response time differ between call types? Here, you might want to use group_by().\nExplore some temporal trends. What hours of the day have the highest frequency of shots fired? Here, you will want to make use of functions in the lubridate package.\n\nSee you on Tuesday!\n\nSam Langton is a postdoc researcher on the evidence-based policing programme at the NSCR. His research focuses on describing and explaining the spatial and temporal patterning of police demand. Sam is interested in promoting open science in criminology, particularly through open data and sharing his knowledge (and struggles) in R.\n\n\n\nMaterials\nAll you need is the script mentioned above, which can be viewed here. Either copy and paste the code into an R script, or right click on Raw (right hand side) and click Save link as…. Remember to save the script in your scripts folder (see above)."
