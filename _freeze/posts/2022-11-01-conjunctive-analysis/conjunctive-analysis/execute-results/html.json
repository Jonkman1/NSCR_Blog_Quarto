Asier will first introduce the CACC and then perform a live demonstration of the `cacc` package from RStudio.\n\nJoin this workshop meeting on Zoom by clicking [this link](https://us02web.zoom.us/j/81620041716?pwd=cjFCbG9TVHc0NTUrcmxmend5WHdCQT09)\n\n> **Asier Moneva** is a postdoc at the NSCR and The Hague University of Applied Sciences with a background in criminology. He started specializing in crime analysis with R during his master's degree and has since developed an interest in open science.\n\n### Materials\n\n-   A [link](https://github.com/amoneva/cacc) to the development version of the `cacc` R package in GitHub. The `README.md` file contains a description of the package and walks readers through some examples.\n-   \\[Placeholder for the slides from Asier's workshop presentation\\]\n\nAsier will use the following R packages in the workshop:\n\n-   `devtools`\n-   `tidyverse`\n\nTo install them, you can run the code below:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nif (! require(\"devtools\")) install.packages(\n  pkgs = \"devtools\",\n  repos = \"http://cran.us.r-project.org\"\n)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n```\nWarning: package 'usethis' was built under R version 4.1.3\n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nif (! require(\"tidyverse\")) install.packages(\n  pkgs = \"tidyverse\",\n  repos = \"http://cran.us.r-project.org\"\n)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n```\nWarning: package 'tidyverse' was built under R version 4.1.3\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n```\nWarning: package 'ggplot2' was built under R version 4.1.3\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n```\nWarning: package 'tibble' was built under R version 4.1.3\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n```\nWarning: package 'tidyr' was built under R version 4.1.3\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n```\nWarning: package 'readr' was built under R version 4.1.3\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n```\nWarning: package 'dplyr' was built under R version 4.1.3\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n```\nWarning: package 'stringr' was built under R version 4.1.3\n```\n:::\n:::\n",
