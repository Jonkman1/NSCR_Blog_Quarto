[Asier Moneva](https://twitter.com/crimoneva) explores the following research questions: \"What are the top 3 best-selling board games by game type?\" and \"How do board game sales relate to online user ratings?\" Feel free to explore these questions yourselves and share your experience with us.\n\n### Materials\n\n-   The R script that Asier worked through is in [this Github repository](https://github.com/amoneva/tidy_tuesday/blob/main/week4_board_games.R).\n-   The Tidy Data paper (pre-print) by Hardley Wickham (2014) is [here](https://vita.had.co.nz/papers/tidy-data.pdf).\n\n### How to download files from GitHub\n\nTo download files from GitHub you can:\n\n`Clone` the repository to create a local copy in your computer. To clone a repository, follow the instructions [here](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository).\n\nAlternatively, you can:\n\n1.
