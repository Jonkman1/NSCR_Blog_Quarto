You are already familar with them because whenever you type, for example, `library(dplyr)` in your R script you are using a package \\`dplyr' and its functions. In this workshop **Sophie Curtis-Ham** will demonstrate how you yourself can create R packages.\n\nNote that the workshop is in the morning: **10:00-11:00**. Join this workshop meeting on Zoom by clicking [this link](https://us02web.zoom.us/j/83201028780?pwd=bVV6dnlWZFdmYUFINElBczhYZGlJQT09)\n\n> **Sophie Curtis-Ham**, PhD, is Senior Research and Insights Advisor at the New Zealand police. She is the author of the R package `gpsmartr`, a tool for supporting geographic offender profiling.\n\n### Materials\n\nThe [slides](NSCR%20workshop%20R%20packages%2020220609.pdf) that Sophie uses in the workshop.\n\nSophie uses a couple of R packages in the workshop:\n\nTo reproduce the examples, you need to have installed a couple of packages (devtools, usethis, tidyverse, rlang, broom, here). To install them all, run: `install.packages(c(\"devtools\",\"usethis\", \"tidyverse\", \"rlang\", \"broom\", \"here\"))`\n\n### Contact\n[Sophie Curtiz-Ham](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Sophie-Curtis-Ham)\n",
