In this workshop we laerned why and how you can use the R package `mice` to solve missing data problems by means of multiple imputation. Multiple imputation is a generic approach to analyse incomplete data that reduces bias and increases precision.

To get an idea of what the workshop was about, you could read (in Dutch) [this short and accessible overview of multiple imputation](https://stefvanbuuren.name/publications/2012%20Vogelvlucht%20-%20STAtOR.pdf). Alternatively, you could check out the (English) [Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imputation_(statistics)).

To install the R package `mice` , copy and paste the next line into your R Studio Editor and run it:

**install.packages("mice")**

> Stef van Buuren is Professor of Statistical Analysis of Incomplete Data at the University of Utrecht and Principal Scientist at the Netherlands Organisation for Applied Scientific Research TNO in Leiden. He invented the MICE algorithm for multiple imputation of missing data. [Here](https://stefvanbuuren.name) you can find more details about Stef and his work.
