Much information is stored as free-text. Free-text is weakly structured and therefore hard to extract and organize. This workshop will explore some elements of working with free-text data in R, principally how it can be prepared and transformed to be used with machine learning algorithms.

*Anthony Dixon* is a postgraduate researcher at the University of Leeds, working in the [School of Law](https://essl.leeds.ac.uk/law) and the [Leeds Institute of Data Analytics](https://lida.leeds.ac.uk). The topic of his thesis is 'Improving Problem-oriented policing with Natural Language Processing', which seeks to explore the use of state-of-the-art deep learning models to automatically extract information from police free-text data. Additionally he has joint published a number of papers covering crime changes as a result of the covid-19 pandemic.
