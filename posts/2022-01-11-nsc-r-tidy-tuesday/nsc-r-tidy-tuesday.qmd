The NSC-R Tidy Tuesday workshop sessions are inspired by the [Tidy Tuesday](https://www.tidytuesday.com/) initiative, which is aimed at providing a safe and supportive forum for individuals to practice their data processing and visualization skills in R while working with real-world data.

Sam Langton demonstrated some foundational R skills using a [Tidy Tuesday dataset](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2021/2021-12-21/starbucks.csv) on the nutritional (or not so nutritional) content of Starbucks drinks.

> *Sam Langton* is a postdoc researcher on the evidence-based policing programme at the NSCR. His research focuses on describing and explaining the spatial and temporal patterning of police demand. Sam is interested in promoting open science in criminology, particularly through open data and sharing his knowledge (and struggles) in R.
