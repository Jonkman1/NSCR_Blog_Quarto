He also looks at the differences in sport revenues and expenditures between men and women.\n\nJoin this workshop meeting on Zoom by clicking [this link](https://us02web.zoom.us/j/86710142987?pwd=L2o3dDdnZk5OSlJUOFlyNktMMDlpUT09)\n\n> **Alex Trinidad** is a postdoctoral researcher/ lecturer at the Institute of Sociology and Social Psychology (ISS) at the University of Cologne, Germany. He is also a research fellow at the Netherlands Institute for the Study of Crime and Law Enforcement (NSCR). His interest in spatial analysis began when he started his PhD, exploring the spatial distribution of juvenile delinquency and the contextual factors associated with it. It was also during his PhD that he began his journey with R.\n\n\n-   The R script that Alex worked with is in [this GitHub repository](https://github.com/alexandertrinidad/tidy_tuesday/blob/main/tt_nscr_03_05.R) that Alex worked with. Please feel free to copy and paste the syntax in an new R script. If you run the whole script be aware that some errors will come up. Those are made on purpose, and the solution is in the next lines. If the error is due to a lack of package, check some of the comments (#) in the script, and install the needed package.\n\n### How to download files from GitHub\n\nTo download files from GitHub you can:\n\n`Clone` the repository to create a local copy in your computer.
