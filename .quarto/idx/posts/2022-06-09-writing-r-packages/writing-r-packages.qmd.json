You are already familar with them because whenever you type, for example, `library(dplyr)` in your R script you are using a package \\`dplyr' and its functions. In this workshop **Sophie Curtis-Ham** will demonstrate how you yourself can create R packages.\n\nNote that the workshop is in the morning: **10:00-11:00**. Join this workshop meeting on Zoom by clicking [this link](https://us02web.zoom.us/j/83201028780?pwd=bVV6dnlWZFdmYUFINElBczhYZGlJQT09)\n\n> **Sophie Curtis-Ham**, PhD, is Senior Research and Insights Advisor at the New Zealand police. She is the author of the R package `gpsmartr`, a tool for supporting geographic offender profiling.\n\n### Materials\n\nThe [slides](NSCR%20workshop%20R%20packages%2020220609.pdf) that Sophie uses in the workshop.\n\nSophie uses a couple of R packages in the workshop:\n\nTo reproduce the examples, you need to have installed a couple of packages (devtools, usethis, tidyverse, rlang, broom, here). To install them all, run: `install.packages(c(\"devtools\",\"usethis\", \"tidyverse\", \"rlang\", \"broom\", \"here\"))`\n\n### Contact\n[Sophie Curtiz-Ham](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Sophie-Curtis-Ham)\n"},"formats":{"html":{"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":true,"echo":true,"output":{"distill::distill_article":{"self_contained":false}},"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"knitr"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-yaml":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","output-file":"writing-r-packages.html"},"language":{},"metadata":{"lang":"en","fig-responsive":true,"quarto-version":"0.9.345","editor":"visual","theme":"../../theme.scss","title-block-banner":true,"title":"Writing R packages","description":"How to write R packages that make life easier for you yourself and for others\n","author":[{"name":"Sophie Curtis-Ham","url":"https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Sophie-Curtis-Ham"}],"date":"06-09-2022","categories":["theory"],"image":"Screenshot.PNG"},"extensions":{"book":{"multiFile":true}}}}}
