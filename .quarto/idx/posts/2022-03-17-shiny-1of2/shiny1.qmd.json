Note that this was the first session of a two-sesssion workshop. This first session was be a basic introduction on the different components of a shiny app. In the second session (on Thursday March 31) we explored into more depth how 'reactivity' works, an important component of most shiny apps.\n\nFor inspiration, you may want to spend a few minutes viewing some [fun apps](https://www.rstudio.com/blog/3-fun-shiny-apps-for-your-long-labor-day-weekend/) made with `shiny`, or [this `shiny` gallery](https://shiny.rstudio.com/gallery/).\n\nTo prepare for the workshop, you could install these two R packages (just copy and paste this line into your R Studio Editor and run it)\n\ninstall.packages(c(\"tidyverse\", \"shiny\"))\n\n> **Nick van Doormaal** is a former PhD candidate at the NSCR and currently a data analyst at the environmental service of the province of Gelderland. He got into R during his MSc thesis and internship and has been using R ever since.\n\n\nOn Nick's GitHub repository [nscr-shiny-workshop](https://github.com/nvdoormaal/nscr-shiny-workshop) you can find the data and the R script that documents the development that Nick demonstrated during the second workshop on Thursday March 31.\n\n### How to download files from GitHub\n\nTo download files from GitHub you can:\n\n`Clone` the repository to create a local copy in your computer.
