His research focuses on describing and explaining the spatial and temporal patterning of police demand. Sam is interested in promoting open science in criminology, particularly through open data and sharing his knowledge (and struggles) in R.\n\n\n-   You can find the material for this workshop [here](https://github.com/langtonhugh/nscr_graphics).\n\n### Citation\n\nFor attribution, please cite this work as [@s_langton_nsc-r_2022]\n"},"formats":{"html":{"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":true,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"markdown"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[]},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","output-file":"nsc-r-tidy-tuesday.html"},"language":{},"metadata":{"lang":"en","fig-responsive":true,"quarto-version":"1.2.269","editor":"visual","theme":"../../theme.scss","title-block-banner":true,"title":"NSC-R Tidy Tuesday","description":"Improve your R skills in entertaining, inspiring and supportive sessions presented by your colleagues.\n","author":"Sam Langton","date":"December 11 2021","categories":["wrangling","visualization"],"image":"Screenshot.PNG","bibliography":["C:/FilesHarrie/Quarto/NSCR/website/NSCR_Web_Quatro/NSCR_Blog_Quarto/references/references.bib"]},"extensions":{"book":{"multiFile":true}}}}}
