It is also essential for collaboration with other researchers and developers.\n\n**Git**, **GitHub** in combination with **R/RStudio** allow you to back up texts and scripts and to collaborate on complex projects. Git and GitHub are open source version control systems which work quiet well together with R/RStudio.\n\nThis workshop introduced this system, demonstrated how to create a repository on GitHub, and how to do this from R/RStudio (see [Harrie's presentation (PDF)](VersioncontrolGit.pdf)).\n\nThe workshop also included a live demonstration of how collaboration between multiple people works in a simple repository/project.\n\nThe workshop was connected to the subsequent workshop in which the new NSC-R Workshop website was be presented (the one you are reading now). This website is developed by the NSC-R team members who worked together on this in Git, GitHub and R/RStudio.\n\n\nBelow are links to potentially usefull sources about Git, Github and their integration with R/RStudio.\n\n-   Douglas, A., Roos, D., Mancini, F., Couto, A. and Lusseau, D., *An introduction to R*, chapter 9, [here](https://intro2r.com/github_r.html).\n\n-   Bryan, J., *Happy Git and GitHub for the useR*, [here](https://happygitwithr.com/)\n\n-   Lendway, L., *github_for_collaboration*, [here](https://github.com/llendway/github_for_collaboration)\n\n### Lisa Lendway on YouTube\n\n-   [Using Git and GitHub in R Studio](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLFc9gw_Hfs)\n\n-   [Using Git and GitHub in R](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=megZYkCLMA4)\n\n> [Harrie Jonkman](https://www.harriejonkman.nl)is a senior researcher at the [Verwey Jonker Institute](https://www.verwey-jonker.nl/). He works in the field of cognitive and social development of children and youngsters in relation to the contexts in which they grow up (family, school, friends, community and country). Recently he edited with David Farrington and Frederick Groeger-Roth [Delinquency and Substance Use in Europe. Understanding Risk and Protective Factors](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-030-58442-9).

He is interested in open-source data analysis and has his blog [Harrie's Hoekje](http://www.harriejonkman.nl/HarriesHoekje/) on this topic.\n\n### Citation\n\nFor attribution, please cite this work as [@jonkman_nsc-r_2021}\n"},"formats":{"html":{"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":true,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"markdown"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-yaml":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","output-file":"github.html"},"language":{},"metadata":{"lang":"en","fig-responsive":true,"quarto-version":"0.9.345","editor":"visual","theme":"../../theme.scss","title-block-banner":true,"title":"Using GitHub","description":"A workshop on using GitHub for version control, collaboration and code sharing.\n","author":"Harrie Jonkman","date":"November 25 2021","categories":["collaboration"],"image":"Screenshot.PNG","bibliography":["C:/FilesHarrie/Quarto/NSCR/website/NSCR_Web_Quatro/NSCR_Blog_Quarto/references/references.bib"]},"extensions":{"book":{"multiFile":true}}}}}
