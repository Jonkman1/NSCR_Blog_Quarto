These surveys, however, are only designed to allow aggregating responses and producing reliable direct estimates (i.e., weighted means or totals) at very large spatial scales, such as countries or states. Sample sizes are too small to produce direct estimates of adequate precision at the increasingly refined spatial scales of the criminology of place. Model-based small area estimation techniques may be used to improve the reliability of small area estimates produced from victimization surveys. Small area estimation techniques are applied to produce reliable estimates of parameters of interest (and their associated measures of error) for areas for which only small or zero sample sizes are available. This workshop will introduce theory and show a step-by-step exemplar study in R to illustrate the utility of small area estimation for crime and place research.
