The topic of this first meeting was reproducibility, which is about how to organize your research workflow to create documented code and reproducible findings. The focus **was not on why** (we should know), but on practical guidelines **on how to do it**. It was presented by Thomas de Graaff.\n\nHere you find the [presentation](https://www.dropbox.com/s/vn7rn9m5ht2miol/reproducibility.pdf?dl=0)\n\nTo prepare for the first meeting, Thomas de Graaff suggested you might want to take a look at the following links. This is obviously not mandatory, but the materials may give rise to ideas or questions that you may want to discuss in the workshop meeting:\n\n-   A very readable post on [reproducible workflow in R](https://cyberhelp.sesync.org/blog/reproducible-r-workflow.html).\n\n-   A nice short blog post [about R projects](https://www.tidyverse.org/blog/2017/12/workflow-vs-script/).\n\n-   If you are using R already and in particular if you use tidyverse, a long book-down document about [coding style conventions](https://style.tidyverse.org/index.html).\n\n-   A wonderful but distressing lecture (and long: about 50 minutes) from Richard McElreath about working with software in the social sciences, with a criminology paper example in the end on racial disparity in police use of deadly force.
