Free-text is weakly structured and therefore hard to extract and organize. This workshop will explore some elements of working with free-text data in R, principally how it can be prepared and transformed to be used with machine learning algorithms.\n\nJoin this workshop meeting on Zoom by clicking [this link](https://us02web.zoom.us/j/85477754782?pwd=cExxK2NCSFVWdERVcERMMVg3WjFCdz09)\n\n*Anthony Dixon* is a postgraduate researcher at the University of Leeds, working in the [School of Law](https://essl.leeds.ac.uk/law) and the [Leeds Institute of Data Analytics](https://lida.leeds.ac.uk). The topic of his thesis is 'Improving Problem-oriented policing with Natural Language Processing', which seeks to explore the use of state-of-the-art deep learning models to automatically extract information from police free-text data. Additionally he has joint published a number of papers covering crime changes as a result of the covid-19 pandemic.\n\n\nYou can download the materials used in the workshop [here](https://github.com/Jonkman1/NSCR_Web/raw/main/materials/text_analytics_files.zip).\n"},"formats":{"html":{"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":true,"echo":true,"output":{"distill::distill_article":{"self_contained":false}},"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"knitr"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-yaml":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","output-file":"text-analysis-in-r.html"},"language":{},"metadata":{"lang":"en","fig-responsive":true,"quarto-version":"0.9.345","editor":"visual","theme":"../../theme.scss","title-block-banner":true,"title":"Text analysis in R","description":"How to process free-text data in R\n","author":[{"name":"Anthony Dixon","url":"https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Anthony-Dixon-10/"}],"date":"02-03-2022"},"extensions":{"book":{"multiFile":true}}}}}
