His research focuses on describing and explaining the spatial and temporal patterning of police demand. Sam is interested in promoting open science in criminology, particularly through open data and sharing his knowledge (and struggles) in R.\n\n### Materials\n\n-   You can find the material for this workshop [in this GitHub repository](https://github.com/langtonhugh/nscr_graphics).\n\n### How to download files from GitHub\n\nTo download files from GitHub you can:\n\n`Clone` the repository to create a local copy in your computer.
