Note that this is the second session of a two-sesssion workshop. The first session (on Thursday March 17) was be a basic introduction on the different components of a shiny app. In this second session we explore into more depth how 'reactivity' works, an important component of most shiny apps.\n\nTo prepare for the workshop, you may want to take a look this [key resource](https://mastering-shiny.org/) for `shiny`, in particular Chapter 3.\n\nIn advance of the workshop, we suggest you install these two R packages (just copy and paste this line into your R Studio Editor and run it)\n\ninstall.packages(c(\"tidyverse\", \"shiny\"))\n\n> **Nick van Doormaal** is a former PhD candidate at the NSCR and currently a data analyst at the environmental service of the province of Gelderland. He got into R during his MSc thesis and internship and has been using R ever since.\n\nJoin this workshop meeting on Zoom by clicking [this link](https://us02web.zoom.us/j/86850017443?pwd=cnE5Wmw0Tk9TbE1kTEc1aCtMdFhDUT09)\n\n### Materials\n\nOn Nick's GitHub repository [nscr-shiny-workshop](https://github.com/nvdoormaal/nscr-shiny-workshop) you can find the data and the R script that documents the development that Nick demonstrated during the workshop.\n\n### How to download files from GitHub\n\nTo download files from GitHub you can:\n\n`Clone` the repository to create a local copy in your computer. To clone a repository, follow the instructions [here](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository).\n\nAlternatively, you can:\n\n1.  Download all files compressed in a `ZIP`. To do this, go to the repository and click on the green `code` button, then select `download ZIP`. Unzip the downloaded file into a folder on your local computer.\n2.  Download a specific file. To do this, select the desired file in the repository and click on the `raw` button. Then right click on the new page and select `save as`. Don't forget to put the proper extension in the save name, like `.R` or `.Rmd`.\n",
